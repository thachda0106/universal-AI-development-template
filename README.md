# Universal AI Development Template

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A **tool-agnostic AI development template** that works across Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, Aider, and future AI IDEs.

Define your AI agents, workflows, skills, and conventions **once** in a canonical `.ai/` directory. Adapters translate them into tool-native formats automatically.

## Architecture

```

adapters/                ← Tool-specific translation layers
├── claude/              ← Claude Code → .claude/ + CLAUDE.md
├── antigravity/         ← Antigravity → .agent/ + .gemini/

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy the template

Copy `.ai/` and `adapters/` into your project root.

### 2. Fill in context files

Edit these files with your project's details:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.ai/context/PROJECT.md` | Project name, tech stack, commands, architecture |
| `.ai/context/CONVENTIONS.md` | Coding standards, naming conventions |
| `.ai/context/BOUNDARIES.md` | What the AI should never do |

### 3. Install for your AI tool

```bash
# Auto-detect installed tools
bash .ai/scripts/install-ai-template.sh

# Or install a specific adapter
bash adapters/antigravity/install.sh
bash adapters/claude/install.sh
bash adapters/cursor/install.sh
bash adapters/aider/install.sh
bash adapters/opencode/install.sh
```

### 4. Validate

```bash
bash .ai/scripts/validate-template.sh
```

## 🏗️ Build Large System Workflow

The flagship workflow: a **30-phase BigTech-level system development lifecycle** across **8 stages**, reflecting how Amazon, Google, Netflix, Uber, and Stripe build distributed systems.

```
Stage A: Discovery & Requirements  → Phases 01–03
Stage B: Domain & Architecture     → Phases 04–11
Stage C: Platform & Infrastructure → Phases 12–16
Stage D: Service Development       → Phases 17–19
Stage E: Hardening                 → Phases 20–25
Stage F: Launch                    → Phases 26–27
Stage G: Operations                → Phases 28–29
Stage H: Evolution                 → Phase 30
```

**Get started**: Read the [Build Large System Usage Guide](.ai/docs/BUILD_LARGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Workflow files**:
- [Master overview](.ai/workflows/build-large-system.md) — Phase table, dependency graph, folder structure
- [Phases 01–10](.ai/workflows/build-large-system-phases-01-10.md) — Discovery → Architecture
- [Phases 11–20](.ai/workflows/build-large-system-phases-11-20.md) — Platform → Service Dev
- [Phases 21–30](.ai/workflows/build-large-system-phases-21-30.md) — Hardening → Operations → Evolution

## 🚀 Build Minimum System Workflow

A **compressed 9-phase workflow** derived from the 30-phase lifecycle, designed for **solo developers or small teams**. Same architectural thinking, no enterprise overhead.

```
Phase 1: Business & Domain Discovery    ← Phases 01-03
Phase 2: Architecture & Domain Design   ← Phases 04-06
Phase 3: Data, API & Contract Design    ← Phases 07-09
Phase 4: System Flows & Tech Stack      ← Phases 10-12
Phase 5: Platform Skeleton & Dev Setup  ← Phases 13-15
Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline (lean)          ← Phase 16
Phase 7: Build: Vertical Slice → Full   ← Phases 17-19
Phase 8: Observability & Hardening      ← Phases 20-25
Phase 9: Deploy, Stabilize & Evolve     ← Phases 26-30
```

**Timeline**: ~6-8 weeks solo, ~10-14 weeks small team.

**Workflow file**: [build-minimum-system.md](.ai/workflows/build-minimum-system.md)

## Design Principles

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tool-agnostic core** | All agents, workflows, skills live in `.ai/` using generic language |
| **Adapter pattern** | Each AI tool gets a thin adapter translating `.ai/` into tool-native format |
| **Convention over configuration** | Standard filenames and YAML frontmatter |
| **Composable** | Each module (agent, skill, workflow) is independent and opt-in |
| **5-phase operating model** | Plan → Review → Execute → Verify → Reflect |

## Operating Model

Every non-trivial task follows 5 phases:

```
PLAN → REVIEW (hard stop) → EXECUTE → VERIFY → REFLECT
```

The AI creates a scratchpad, stops for human approval, implements the plan, verifies results, and reflects on what was learned.

In workflows, these phases expand into 6 detailed steps: **Scratchpad → Plan → Tasks → Execute → Verify → Reflect**, with approval gates between each phase.
